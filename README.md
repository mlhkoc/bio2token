# Bio2Token: Deep Learning Autoencoder for Biological Tokenization

Bio2Token is a deep learning-based autoencoder designed for quantizing any biological structures into a discrete token format. This is the official repository of the paper [Bio2Token: All-atom tokenization of any biomolecular structure with Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19110).

## Setup Guide

To manage environments efficiently, we use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer). It simplifies managing dependencies and executing scripts.

- Install `uv` and synchronize your environment:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv sync
    ```

## Weights & Biases (WandB)

This project uses Weights & Biases (WandB) for experiment tracking. Create a project on WandB (https://wandb.ai/) and optionally set an `entity` for your team or user account. You can configure the WandB project in `configs/trainer.yaml` under the `wandb` key.

Example config (in `configs/trainer.yaml`):

```yaml
wandb:
  project: bio2token
  entity: null
```

If you haven't already, login locally using:

```bash
wandb login
```

## Model Architecture

The autoencoder consists of Mamba layers and a FSQ quantizer layer. The model implementation can be found in `src/bio2token/models/autoencoder.py`. You can customize the model configuration via `configs/model.yaml`. Both RMSD and Inter-Atom Distance are used as loss functions, with TM-score available for monitoring performance.

## Datasets

We provide pre-processed datasets for download from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15199953). Unzip the directory into the highest level of the repo: `bio2token/data`. The `data/` folder contains:

- [CATH dataset](http://download.cathdb.info/cath/releases/all-releases/v4_3_0/non-redundant-data-sets/)
- [CASP 14](https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/targetlist.cgi) and [15 datasets](https://predictioncenter.org/casp15/targetlist.cgi) (testing only)
- [NablaDFT dataset](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/nablaDFT)
- [RNA3DB dataset](https://github.com/marcellszi/rna3db)

Adjust data configurations using `configs/data.yaml`. Pre-processed AlphaFoldDB data is also available upon request.

```
## Training

Train the Bio2Token model with the following command:
```bash
uv run scripts/train.py --config train.yaml
```
Configuration details are available in `configs/train.yaml`, which imports `model.yaml`, `data.yaml`, and `trainer.yaml`. The model weights are saved under `checkpoints/${experiment_name}/${run_id}`.


## Testing

To test the model on a pre-processed dataset, use:
```bash
uv run scripts/test.py --config test.yaml
```
Configure the dataset and model weights in `configs/test.yaml`:
```yaml
infer:
  experiment_name: bio2token
  run_id: bio2token_pretrained
data:
  ds_name: rna3db
```
Results are saved under `results/${experiment_name}/${run_id}/${checkpoint_name}/${ds_name}/${split_name}/test_outputs.parquet`.

## Testing on Raw PDB Files

Test on raw PDB files using:
```bash
uv run scripts/test_pdb.py --config test_pdb.yaml
```
Specify the PDB file and model weights in `configs/test_pdb.yaml`:
```yaml
infer:
  experiment_name: bio2token
  run_id: bio2token_pretrained
data:
  ds_name: examples/pdbs/107l.pdb
```

Results are saved under `results/pdb/${pdb_id}/${run_id}/${checkpoint_name}/`. The ground-truth and reconstructed structures as well as the losses and estimated tokens are saved as `gt.pdb`, `rec.pdb`, and `outputs.json`.
